# Lua interpreter initialization

Initialization of pandoc's Lua interpreter can be controlled by
placing a file `init.lua` in pandoc's data directory. A common
use-case would be to load additional modules, or even to alter
default modules.

The following snippet is an example of code that might be useful
when added to `init.lua`. The snippet adds all Unicode-aware
functions defined in the [`text` module](#module-text) to the
default `string` module, prefixed with the string `uc_`.

``` lua
for name, fn in pairs(require 'text') do
  string['uc_' .. name] = fn
end
```

This makes it possible to apply these functions on strings using
colon syntax (`mystring:uc_upper()`).
